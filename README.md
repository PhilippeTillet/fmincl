UMinTL
======

This project is a generic unconstrained minimization library relying heavily on template metaprogramming.

##Features

* Use **any** Linear Algebra backend

The linear algebra routines are well separated from the algorithm implementations.
You can pass a custom backend in the optimization procedure. This backend should just include a few typedefs, linear algebra routine and procedures to allocate/delete a Vector/Matrix.
For now, cblas and ViennaCL are available, for using either CPU or OpenCL in the optimization procedure and the objective function.

* An **extendable** library

UMinTL relies on template. You may therefore write your own stopping criterion (eg a cross-validation error if you're doing machine learning). More experienced user may also write their own restarting condition for the conjugate gradient, or their own update direction.

* A **clear** interface

UMinTL provides a clear API, where any functor can be passed to the optimization algorithm. The cumbersomeness of the templates is softened using type-erasure mechanism.

* A **robust** package

UMinTL was extensively tested on the test suite described in "Testing Unconstrained Optimization Software" (JJ Mor√© and al.). However, it will never be robust enough. If the procedure fails on your particular problem, please *report*.

* **Multiple procedures** available

The library supports BFGS, L-BFGS, and Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient. Several updates and restart procedures are available for the conjugate gradient method.
The line-search is done using the strong wolfe-powell conditions.
